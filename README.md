# ML Models, Datasets & Supervised Learning

This repository contains practical Python code and datasets for exploring a wide range of machine learning concepts, with a strong focus on **supervised learning**. The materials are organized into thematic sections to support structured learning and experimentation.

## üìÅ Contents

- **Data Preprocessing**  
  Handling missing data, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling, and data splitting.

- **Regression Models**  
  Linear regression, polynomial regression, decision tree regression, and random forest regression.

- **Classification Algorithms**  
  Logistic regression, K-nearest neighbors (KNN), SVM, Naive Bayes, decision trees, and random forests.

- **Clustering Techniques** *(Unsupervised)*  
  K-Means and hierarchical clustering.

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**  
  Basic text preprocessing, Bag-of-Words, and sentiment analysis.

- **Dimensionality Reduction**  
  PCA and LDA to visualize and compress feature space.

- **Reinforcement Learning**  
  Q-Learning and intuition behind agents learning via reward systems.

## üéØ Learning Focus

The **primary focus is supervised learning** (classification and regression), but several **unsupervised learning** techniques are also introduced to provide a complete perspective on core machine learning workflows.

## üîß Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn
- nltk, XGBoost (where applicable)
